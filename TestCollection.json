Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. > > Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): > > \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\" > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

[Honestly.] The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?] Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals? Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order. Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression. I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of the Order to which I belong. When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a service. He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order for many years. Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual. I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself. Let us examine this issue a bit more closely.... \"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis. Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices. Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O. The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'. On Kellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.]. The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic. \"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character. Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876. He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband. Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker. Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany. After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O. \"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA. In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred. Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets. When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time. Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox. \"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor. All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German. There was a break in the continuity of the Order. Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\" _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX' Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus, Caliph of the United States of America, Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990. There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_. And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization? Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema? Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers? A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations. It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them. And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best. Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way? Will I? I think not. Why? Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example. My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first. So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'. Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity. If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order? Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles? Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement? How shall we resolve these two possibilities? I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information. They are quite often artists and geniuses. Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands. I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta. In these moments I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body. I'm happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes. This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members. I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far. There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision. I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread. Invoke me under my stars. Love is the law, love under will. I am I!

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that \"the people\" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example. I quote: \"... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution. The Preamble declares that the Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the the U.S.' The Second Amendment protects the right of the people to keep and bear Arms ....\" - Supreme Court of the U.S., U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990). Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the interpretation. Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis: \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi- cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\" - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 ) You might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?\" Well, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines \"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17). \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense .... And ... these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\" - Supreme Court of the United States, U.S. v. Miller (1939). The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around. \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\" - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776 1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950). \"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ? Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939). \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.\" - Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888). You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine it away. I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already. However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography. Lets get it out of here.

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May. It has had many, many problems. See my earler post that describes the situation. I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me. If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear. They have put three of them in my truck so far. After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly. There is no way to fix them. Chevrolet says that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\" Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck. On a steep hill, you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line). If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed. I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones. They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\" reasons. So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does. Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between stabilizer and control arm fell off). Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included. What really bothered me was the way they reacted. They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time. So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic. I will never buy another Chevrolet. jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com",

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable. The concepts of \"right\" and \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions. It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position). Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics: perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true, veridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory). But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false. On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives. Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment. Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled: I agree with the first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above. But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war. I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\" of the position. Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d). My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect). They simply hold different moral values (feelings). ----------------------------------- John A.

Well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole. As it got closer to the event horizon, the red shift would keep increasing. The period would get longer and longer, but it would never stop. An observer would not observe the probe actually reaching the event horizon. The detected energy from the probe would keep decreasing, but it wouldn't vanish. Exp(-t) never quite reaches zero.

I knew there was a double bond! Now how shall I show that in ASCII? MEK: Acetone: C - C - C - C C - C - C # # O O The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond. MEK has a methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other. Acetone has two methyls. So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead is dimethyl ketone. Both solvents have similar properties. I think that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe. It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was. Use acetone. Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.

Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a and some local governments. The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you a riskier driver to insure. Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO! Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as commission. That's another story for another day.",

A word of warning, though: Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name. When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike. I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle. For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable. After less than a week, I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock. First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance. It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it. Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke. I don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it. Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark. I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the lock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\" attack. Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is). All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time. If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers. Aviation snips would go through the cable in well under a minute. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Robinson UUCP: ucbvax!cogsci!robinson INTERNET: robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu",

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty.

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation. You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks. Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you can too. One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager. -Steve",

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway, here's description of the card: It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything. It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4. There is also an external female connector with 37 pins. There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers. I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports. SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5. The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is \"MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD\" across the bottom. There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words \"SERIAL NO\", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers \"1990 2 8\". Anyone have any clues?

Convenient? It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to alt.conspiracy. Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree' measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions: 1. You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C. Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C. Even if the gun were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be trivial to identify the nature of the weapon. 2. A fire is not an isothermal process. There are 'hot' spots and 'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term. So the weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to imply. And, even if it was, so what? It would not have melted anyway. darin wilkins@scubed.com ________________________________ | | | I will be President for food | |______________________________|",

You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them. We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans. The difference is that swept wings don't change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do. Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion? 747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings. >Winglets. Area ruling. Digital fly by wire. Ride smoothing. Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military... After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them. Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field. Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively). It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement. The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us. The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts. Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were. (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.) Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer! The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.

        "From: sharon@world.std.com (Sharon M Gartenberg) Subject: From Srebrenica: \"Doctoring\" in Hell Summary: What it's like WITHOUT modern medicine in war Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA Lines: 84 SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August. But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon. ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'' Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla, the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there. ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters. Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections. He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated 4,000 patients. He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said. His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children. The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said. ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.'' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine. The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'' Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-September he had run out of supplies. ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding. ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types. ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said. The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres. But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.'' Then the hunger set in. Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said. ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said. According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege. Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla. ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.'' -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham, MA USA e-mail: sharon@world.std.com",

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context. First of all, \"ceremonial law\" is an extraScriptural term. It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture. But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath. Paul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath. The word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day. If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws. If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\" But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings. Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?) Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day. Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves. It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory. Why is there no mention of this in the epistles? Link Hudson.",

A lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible- distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action protected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also said that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\" Schools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts,\" according to Lynn. Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools. They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position somewhat disheartening. I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other hand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality turn into no position at all? I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment. The other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced \"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St. Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents. I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin. Now, that's ironic! I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid. However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions.

The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered, many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives, and honour of the Muslims be protected.\" Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

To put it a little differently: - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer. - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver. Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't assert anything). The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired. If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and that certainly isn't a requirement.) - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons. And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers. Joe Morris / MITRE (jcmorris@mitre.org)",
